# ITADATAhack 2023 Project: Classification of European Union Laws into Chapters and Subchapters

This project, developed by my team and me, secured us the second place in the final rankings of ITADATAhack 2023, hosted by Open Data Playground.

## Day 1: Classification of Laws into 20 Chapters

- On the first day of the challenge, we focused on classifying laws into 20 main chapters.
- Our approach involved utilizing techniques in textual analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and a machine learning algorithm to assign each law to its corresponding chapter.
- You can find the details of this work in the Day_1 folder.

## Day 2: Classification of Laws into Chapters and Subchapters

- On the second day, we elevated our project to the next level. In addition to classifying into main chapters, we implemented the subdivision of laws into subchapters. Each law was assigned to a main chapter and a specific subchapter.
- You can find the details of this work in the Day_2 folder.

## Day 3: Classification of Laws into Multiple Subchapters

- On the third day, we further refined the classification system. Now, each law can belong to multiple subchapters, enabling more detailed and flexible categorization of laws.
- You can find the details of this work in the Day_3 folder.
